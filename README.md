# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-Project
## 📌 Project Overview
This is a **Tic Tac Toe game** implemented in **Java** with an added **scoring system**.  
Instead of ending immediately when a player wins, this version calculates how many winning lines (rows, columns, diagonals) each player completes.  
At the end of the game, the final scores are displayed, and the player with the higher score wins.  

This project was built to practice **problem solving, clean coding, and game logic design**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Two-player gameplay (X and O)
- Position validation (prevents overwriting an already filled cell)
- Board display after every move
- Scoring system based on completed rows, columns, and diagonals
- Declares **Final Winner** based on scores
- Handles draw conditions

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Java (Core Java, OOP concepts, Arrays, Loops, Conditionals)
- **IDE/Tools**: VS Code / Eclipse / IntelliJ

---

## 📖 What I Learned
- Designing a **game loop** with input validation
- Implementing **scoring logic** for rows, columns, and diagonals
- Handling **edge cases** like invalid moves and repeated positions
- Writing modular code with **helper methods** (e.g., `printBoard()`, `calculateScore()`)

## 📂 How to Run
1. Open the file **Main.java** in your IDE or text editor.  
2. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
3. Run the program:
     java Main

✅ **2. Demo (Screenshot/Output)**  
Recruiters love **visual proof**. Add a sample board screenshot or console output like this:  
```markdown
## 🎥 Demo
Example gameplay in console:

|---|---|---|
| X | O | X |
|-----------|
| O | X | O |
|-----------|
| X |   | O |
|---|---|---|

Final Scores:  
Player X: 2  
Player O: 1  
---- Player X Wins! ----


## 📌 Future Improvements
- Add a computer AI opponent (using minimax algorithm)  
- Build a Graphical User Interface (GUI) with Java Swing  
- Extend to online multiplayer version
